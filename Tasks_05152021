6. Nikhil - Research proposed methodology to search and select stocks with highest momentum every 1, 2 or 3 months 
            to update universe of stocks to trade for both systems - BB 3SD and Turtle. This must be done in Amibroker 
            with 10-15 years of historical data. Highest momentum stocks should be identified using daily data. Then
            both systems must be back/forward tested on 5 min data of that subset of stocks. Backtest should be on 6
            months and forward test on the next 1, 2, or 3 months.
            Backtest with maximum available historical data for all asset classes in AmiBroker - crypto, stocks, FX, CME futures
            
            **Note: For 3SD BB system in STOCKS ONLY -- will have a 3% target and 5% SL for each day. Keep taking additional trades
            until either the SL or target level has been hit, or until day closes (if neither level is reached until then). 
            Additionally, could have a trailing stop for the portfolio which stops trading at breakeven once 2% return is reached.
